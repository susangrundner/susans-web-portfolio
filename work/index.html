                                    <p><span>Jubilee Austen</span> &ndash; Jubilee is the first website I built. This is strictly a fictional site and fictional person, but a great example of my use of HTML5 and CSS. I love the cool, crisp, cleaness of this website.</p>
                                </div><br><br><br>

                                    <p><span>Rogue Pickings</span> &ndash; This is a fictional site, but another good example of HTML5, CSS, and this time, it was built from a comp. The images were extracted from the comp via Photoshop and loaded back into the site image folder. The links don't work, and for this project, they weren't meant to, but I can very easily add pages and activate those links. I love how the color green was used. Not too overbearing, but just enough to smell the green beans.</p>

                                    <p><span>Aisha's Web Page</span> &ndash; This was a Skillcrush exercise in Flexbox layouts. Just click out of full-page mode and start minimizing the page. Then behold the magic of Flexbox!</p><br><br>
                                </div>

                                    <p><span>Rogue Responsive</span> &ndash; I took the Rogue Pickings website and made it responsive. Like the Aisha site, this site can adapt to any size mobile device, as well as desktops.</p><br><br><br><br>

                                    <p><span>505 - This Page Does Not Exist</span> &ndash; Codepen is a free open source application that allows you to share your code with others. They also issue challeges to see how creative you can be. FYI, this code is all mine. I had fun with this because I was able to let my imagination take over. It's too bad that Unicorns don't really exist.</p>

                                    <p><span>403 - Forbidden Page</span> &ndash; Two words: Dirty Harry. Take a look! You'll make my day!</p>
